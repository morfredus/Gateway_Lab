*Autonomous network inventory and discovery appliance powered by ESP32-S3.*

Gateway Lab is an autonomous network gateway that discovers, identifies and keeps
the history of the devices present on a home local network.

Built around an ESP32-S3, the project favours simplicity of deployment, autonomy,
low power consumption and local data retention.

## Key features

- Multi-protocol discovery (ARP, ICMP, mDNS, SSDP, DNS-SD, NetBIOS...)
- Persistent inventory of detected devices
- Automatic classification (manufacturer, category, type)
- History of connections, disconnections and changes
- Favourites and user notes
- Continuous network monitoring and a per-device stability score
- CSV and JSON export, backup and restore
- Responsive web interface, OTA updates
- Fully local operation, no cloud
